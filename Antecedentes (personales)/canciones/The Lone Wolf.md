# I'm a Lone Wolf

The dark is surrounding
Don't know what they're doing
I'm only a child
my fear is growing

The pain is like knifes
all over my body
I cannot see, I cannot breathe
I think I'm dying...

***[I'm a lone Wolf***
***I have no lord***
***I don't respect the law***
***I'm my own God]***

When I pass by,
people look down,
they're scared.
I'm alone in this awful world

***[I'm a lone Wolf]***

I have no lord,
for lords haven't honour
Don't respect the law,
'cause by evils is done

I'm my own God,
for Gods of people,
died so long ago.

So, fuck this world!

***[I'm a lone Wolf]***

I was only a child,
a pretty face,
soft, pink lips,
and a smooth skin.

Blond hair,
golden locks,
azure eyes,
as the sky where was the sun.

***[I'm a lone Wolf]***

No one loved me,
no one aided me,
neither people,
nor the *fair* law.

***[I'm a lone Wolf]***

But I'm on a trip,
though you won't believe,
I'm searching for love.
*Will anyone love a lone Wolf?*

***[I'm a lone Wolf]***

Come with me,
reject those lords,
despise the laws,
become your own God

For we all die,
and...

Will you be free, or not?
