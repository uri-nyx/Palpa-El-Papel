# The Sad Boy and the Moon

The night is clear,
the Moon in the sky,
throught the window,
a boy crying in the light.

His hair is blond,
his skin is white,
his only eye shines in the night.

The tears are falling,
the sorrow ripping the heart of a boy who was bright.

*"Oh, my love. where have you gone?"*

Fair Moon, who was hearing,
came to the boy's sight,
and said with the voice that throught 
ages and world people revered.

*"Oh boy, sad boy, my son,*
*of pale skin and life hard as stone,*
*your love, he is now gone,*

*For he passed away long time ago.*
*But don't worry, his last thought,*

*were your bangs, and your lips and your locks.*"

And the boy broke in tears,
droplets falling from his eyes of gold,
and wept and sang and made a plea
to Fair Moon that was up above.

*"Oh Moon, bright in the sky*
*grant me this time what I plead,*
*even if never more you hear:*

*Let me, oh Moon, be again with him*
*Let me hug him one more time"*

And the Moon saw the sad boy crying on the corner of his bed.

And the Moon heard a wish for the first and the last time.

And thus she spoke to the little boy whose tears were shining in the night:

*"Oh boy, sad boy, the Wind's child*
*of eyes of gold and golden locks,*

*I will grant you the wish you asked for*
*for this time and never more,*
*do you agree to leave this world?"*

And the boy nodded with the holy golden head.

And his body from the bead then fell.
