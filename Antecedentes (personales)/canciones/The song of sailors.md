# The song of sailors

***[To East! To East!***
***Seeking the Sun we go!***
***With a jar of mead,***
***and a wooden boat,***
***we sail to come back soon!]***

The sky is clear, 
the air is warm, 
the Winds are at our back!

***[To East! To East!]***

The waves are waving,
the West is fading
the Seas are our path!

***[To East! To East!]***

Arr! The moon is rising
the Stars are fading,
we sail, into the night!

***[To East! To East!]***

The water is salty,
the mead is sweet,
and bitter are the thougths of where we lived!

***[To East! To East!]***

The Sun is rising!
There is Fair Moon
Sing! To the West we'll come back soon!

***[To East! To East!]***

You see our captain there in the front,
the Winds blowing his golden locks,
his blue eyes staring the Sun so brigth,
his fair skin shining in the light.

***[To East! To East!]***

*"We're heading back!"* our captain said,
but Wind was mad and forth we went.
Oh! Sorrow's day, our wooden boat was burnt down there!

***[To East! To East!]***

The Seas were kind to our captain fair,
and at a white strand he was laid.

***[To East! To East!]***

And there he saw up on a cliff a little boy with white skin,

*To West! To West!*
*Seeking our home we go!*
*A white rose in hand,*
*in our lips a word,*
*and waiting in high our love!*
